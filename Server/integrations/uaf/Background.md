# FIDO UAF Authenticator

The UAF allows applications to take advantage of the security capabilities of modern devices such as fingerprint 
biometrics, iris recognition, voice biometrics and others. It provides a unified infrastructure that allows you to integrate these capabilities in a simple manner to enable authentication that is both more user friendly and more secure than password

## Typical UAF architecture

This is generic diagram which provides UAF architecture overview. There are 2 parts. One part contains components that resides on the userâ€™s device. Another part is RP and UAF server. The typical gateway between these 2 parts is mobile browser with UAF plugin. The RP should provides proxy capabilities to deliver messages from mobile browser plugin to UAF server.

It's not very convinient when RP is an second device. Non Nok offer OOB API which simplify UAF integration in this case.   

## Device integration models

This is not part of UAF authentication script but shows modular architecture of UAF mobile authentication part.

Some devices will feature a preloaded UAF Client and one or more UAF ASMs. In some cases, 
devices may only feature a preloaded UAF ASM, rather than both a UAF Client and ASM. Older 
legacy devices may feature neither a UAF Client nor a UAF ASM. Nevertheless the App SDK 
can support each of these three scenarios illustrated below from the same mobile application.
